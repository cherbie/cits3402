## Sparse Matrices Project Description
Matrix algebra underpins many compute intense applications in many fields (most fields of Engineering, Machine Learning, Scientific Modelling etc.);
computers were originally used to crunch numbers so numbers we shall crunch.
Your goal, broadly speaking, is to:
 - Create a piece of software implementing a variety of sparse matrix operations
 - Ensure this software conforms to our input/output specification
 - Performance test your software and comment on any speedup you observe (or lack thereof) in a brief report.
